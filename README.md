INDIGO is a proof-of-concept of future INDI based on layered architecture and software bus.

This is the list of requirements taken into the consideration:

1. No GPL/LGPL dependency to allow commercial use under application stores licenses.
2. ANSI C for portability and to allow simple wrapping into .Net, Java, GOlang, Objective-C or Swift in future
3. Layered architecture to allow direct linking of the drivers into applications and or to replace wire protocol.
